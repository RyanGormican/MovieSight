MovieSight -

MovieSight is a front-end web app created with the Vue framework. The application allows the user to view details on the latest popular movies. With the integration of API calls, the user gets displayed on the home page a featured movie along with a list of movies and their descriptions. Users can then click on either the view more for the featured movie or just on the movie itself for the list of movies and get taken to a vision page in order to gain more details about the movie such as its runtime and the country of origin for the film.
